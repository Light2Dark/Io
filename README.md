Im trying to make a music game, where you upload a MIDI file of a song, the game spits out the notes of the song and you have to play the correct notes on the keyboard to play the song.
The notes produced are in musical notation format so that's the main challenge of the game.

Thanks to MPTK Music in the Unity Asset Store for providing essential tools for the game.

Several issues/things to improve:
- The game pauses before the player plays a note. I don't think this has the flow of music that I want. A better system may be needed to track how well a player is doing.
- Main Menu & Settings non-existent
- Symbols for sharps and flats in each key non-existent.
- I'm not sure what to do about very low notes and very high notes. Because the game only has a 1-octave keyboard so although you can play the note, the pitch is wrong. 
- Not to mention, there is no bass cleff yet. I'm not sure how to include that. 
- How to read multiple notes from player. If there are 3 notes to be played simultaneously, player should press all 3 notes, that's a little difficult to do. I'm not sure how yet.
