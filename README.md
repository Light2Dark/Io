Im trying to make a music game, where you upload a MIDI file of a song, the game spits out the notes of the song and you have to play the correct notes on the keyboard to play the song.
The notes produced are in musical notation format so that's the main challenge of the game.

Thanks to MPTK Music in the Unity Asset Store for providing essential tools for the game.

Several issues/things to improve:
- How To Play non-existent
- Symbols for sharps and flats in each key non-existent.
- I'm not sure what to do about very low notes and very high notes. Because the game only has a 2-octave keyboard so although you can play the note, the exact note played is wrong. 
- How to read multiple notes from player. If there are 3 notes to be played simultaneously, player should press all 3 notes, that's a little difficult to do. I'm not sure how yet.
